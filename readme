How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve an app for this project:

XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! Download the code here.
The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the apps, looking for ways they could be improved. Each app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look
specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for both apps, and submit through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.

User Feedback for XYZ Reader:

Lyla says:

“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

Jay says:

“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Kagure says:

“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
